My name is Hanna and I'm 13, almost 14 years old. (On August 24th) I have no siblings but I do have a dog named Charlie and he's 5 1/2 years old. I like the colors blue, red, and black but it I had to choose just one, I'd probably go with blue. My favorite movie ever is the hockey movie Miracle. Ever since the first time I watched it it's been my favorite. I wish I was alive on February 22nd, 1980 in Lake Placid, that would've been so cool. Speaking of hockey, I love hockey. My parents and I like going to Kings games but my favorite team is the Toronto Maple Leafs. I've seen the Leafs before in LA but in January of this year I went to a game in Toronto, and that was so cool! They won. My favorite is number 88, William Nylander. I also like soccer. My favorite team is FC Barcelona, of course over Madrid. A couple summers ago I went to Barcelona and Seville. I have family in Seville, and Barcelona we went to and did lots of things but mainly because I wanted to go to Camp Nou. Unfortunately they were renovating the stadium, but the museum was really cool. They had a wall of jerseys, so so many trophies, a lot of interactive experiences, it was really nice. 

This summer I traveled with my parents. I love travelling. This summer I went to Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. I've gone lots of places, every summer we go to Sweden (I'm half Swedish) and maybe somewhere else. I love going to new places, and I also love languages. I really really really want to go to Brazil. That's like on the top of my list. I also want to go to Morocco really bad. In my life I want to try and learn as many languages as I can. Also go to as many countries as I can. I've been to Canada, Mexico, England, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Japan. There'll be many more to come.
