# Me in Markdown
My name is Hanna and I'm 13, almost 14 years old. (On August 24th) I have no siblings but I do have a dog named Charlie and he's 5 1/2 years old. I like the colors blue, red, and black but it I had to choose just one, I'd probably go with blue. My favorite movie ever is the hockey movie Miracle. Ever since the first time I watched it it's been my favorite. I wish I was alive on February 22nd, 1980 in Lake Placid, that would've been so cool. Speaking of hockey, I love hockey. My parents and I like going to Kings games but my favorite team is the Toronto Maple Leafs. I've seen the Leafs before in LA but in January of this year I went to a game in Toronto, and that was so cool! They won. My favorite is number 88, William Nylander. I also like soccer. My favorite team is FC Barcelona, of course over Madrid. A couple summers ago I went to Barcelona and Seville. I have family in Seville, and Barcelona we went to and did lots of things but mainly because I wanted to go to Camp Nou. Unfortunately they were renovating the stadium, but the museum was really cool. They had a wall of jerseys, so so many trophies, a lot of interactive experiences, it was really nice. 

This summer I traveled with my parents. I love travelling. This summer I went to Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. I've gone lots of places, every summer we go to Sweden (I'm half Swedish) and maybe somewhere else. I love going to new places, and I also love languages. I really really really want to go to Brazil. That's like on the top of my list. I also want to go to Morocco really bad. In my life I want to try and learn as many languages as I can. I listen to music in a lot of languages, each language has a playlist. But I also want to go to as many countries as I can. I want to try foods in their country of origin too. I want kebab in Turkey, feijoada in Brazil, empanadas in Argentina, and gyros in Greece. I've been to Canada, Mexico, England, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Japan. There'll be many more to come. 

My main favorite thing to do is listen to music. I love music of all sorts. Right now, my main genre is rap but I'll listen to pretty much anything. I listen to music in Spanish, Swedish, Portuguese, Norweigan, Danish, Finnish, Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew, Greek, and so much more. Sometimes I listen to Eurovision winners playlists because that's fun to hear what won in whichever year. My favorite artists right now are Victor Leksell, Einar, Bolaget, and Morad. They're all Swedish artists except for Morad. For a while I listened to mainly Spanish and then after that mainly Portuguese. Now it's all different languages and genres. I love music, I listen to it so much. Every year my spotify minutes go up even more.
